Why trust us? </p> <h1> How to Lose Weight Faster, But Safely</h1> <p> No gimmicks, no lies just science-based nutrition strategies to jump-start weight loss.</p> By <span> Jaclyn London, MS, RD, CDN</span> Apr 30, 2021 <span> Enrique D&iacute;az / 7cero</span> <span> Getty Images</span> <p> Lose 5 pounds in one week! It's a trope we see everywhere. And while it&rsquo;s possible that someone can lose that much in that time period, it really depends on your metabolism and loads of other factors unique to you , including physical activity and body composition.<br> </p> <p> Weight loss ultimately comes back to the concept of calories in, calories out : Eat less than you burn and you&rsquo;ll lose weight. And while it&rsquo;s possible to lose water weight quickly on a low-carb diet , I certainly wouldn&rsquo;t advocate for it. The diet itself can trick you into thinking that this eating style is working when really, you might gain back what you lost as soon as you eat carbs again. That can feel incredibly dispiriting if you want results that last longer than a week.</p> <p> Based on my experience in nutrition counseling, most of us tend to snack on foods that aren&rsquo;t nutrient-dense, but are high in calories. Major culprits often come in the form of refined grains like cereals, chips, crackers, and cookies but also calorie-packed drinks like juice and soda. <strong> Skipping sugary beverages is often the easiest way to lose weight </strong> <strong> faster</strong> . You don&rsquo;t feel full from drinks, so swapping those out for sparkling water or unsweetened tea and coffee is the best place to start.</p> <p> If you're looking to speed up weight loss, be mindful of the foods you eat that you don't choose for yourself. Think: food pushers at work or your kids&rsquo; leftovers. Noticing where your extra calories actually come from is another step to making better choices in the short and long term. <br> </p> <p> If you're still looking to lose weight, there are a few tips that hold true for almost all of us across the board and they&rsquo;re concepts that we can put into practice beginning right now. </p> <p> Editor's note: <strong> Weight loss, health and body image are complex subjects</strong> before deciding to go on a diet, we invite you gain a broader perspective by reading our exploration into the hazards of diet culture . </p> <h2> 1. Eat more vegetables, all of the time. </h2> <p> It&rsquo;s that simple, I promise! If you think about making any meal mostly veggies (at least 50% of anything that you&rsquo;re having), you&rsquo;re on the right track to better health. </p> <h2> 2. Build a better breakfast.</h2> <p> All meals are important, but breakfast is what helps you start your day on the right track. The best, heartiest breakfasts are ones that will fill you up, keep you satisfied, and stave off cravings later in the day. Aim to eat anywhere between 400 and 500 calories for your morning meal, and make sure you're including a source of lean protein plus filling fat (e.g., eggs, unsweetened Greek yogurt , nuts, or nut butters) and fiber (veggies, fruit, or 100% whole grains). Starting your day with a blood sugar-stabilizing blend of nutrients will help you slim down.</p> <span> </span> <span> Arx0nt</span> <span> Getty Images</span> <h2> 3. Drink more coffee. </h2> <p> Start your day with a cup of joe . Caffeine is a natural diuretic , which can reduce bloating, and an excellent source of antioxidants, which protect your cells from damage. You can have up to 400 mg about a venti Starbucks coffee daily, according to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. </p> <p> Not much of a coffee drinker? Tea is also a natural diuretic, and types of herbal tea such as dandelion or fennel root can also lend a hand. In fact: When a recent study compared the metabolic effect of green tea (in extract) with that of a placebo, researchers found that the green-tea drinkers burned about 70 additional calories in a 24-hour period.</p> <span> TARIK KIZILKAYA</span> <span> Getty Images</span> <h2> 4. Skip sugary beverages.<br> </h2> <p> We just don't feel full by liquid calories in quite the same way as we do real food<strong> . </strong> Drinking a juice or caramel coffee drink just isn't as satisfying as eating a bowl of veggie- and protein-packed stir-fry. So monitor your intake of juice , soda, sweetened coffee and tea, and alcoholic beverages. If you consume each of those beverages during the day, you'll have taken in at least 800 extra calories by nighttime and you'll still be hungry. (Incidentally, alcohol may suppress the metabolism of fat, making it tougher for you to burn those calories.) </p> <h2> 5. Buy a set of 5-pound weights. </h2> 5-Pound Dumbbells (Pair) <span> CAP Barbell</span> <span> amazon.com</span> $29.97 <span> SHOP NOW</span> <p> Strength training builds lean muscle tissue, which burns more calories at work or at rest 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The more lean muscle you have, the faster you'll slim down. </p> <p> How do you start strength training? Try some push-ups or a few squats or lunges. Use your free weights to perform simple bicep curls or tricep extensions right in your home or office. Mix in some new ab , arm , back , and leg moves if you like. Strength training just three to four times per week can lead to rapid improvement in not only weight loss, but also range of motion, stability, and posture.</p> <h2> 6. Eat spicy foods seriously! </h2> <p> It can actually help you cut back on calories. That's because capsaicin , a compound found in jalape&ntilde;o and cayenne peppers, may (slightly) increase your body's release of stress hormones such as adrenaline, which can speed up your ability to burn calories. What's more, eating hot peppers may help you eat more slowly and avoid overeating. You're more likely to stay more mindful of when you're full. Some great choices besides hot peppers: ginger and turmeric .</p> <span> </span> <span> visionandimagination.com</span> <span> Getty Images</span> <h2> 7. Go to bed earlier. </h2> <p> There's a ton of research that demonstrates getting less than the desired amount about seven hours of sleep per night can slow down your metabolism . Plus, when you're awake for longer, you're naturally more likely to snack on midnight munchies. So don't skimp on your ZZZ's, and you'll be rewarded with an extra edge when it comes to losing weight.</p> <h2> 8. Keep a food journal.</h2> <p> People who log everything they eat especially those who log while <span> </span> they're eating are more likely to lose weight and keep it off for the long haul, studies consistently indicate. The habit also takes less than 15 minutes per day on average when you do it regularly, according to a 2019 study published in Obesity . </p> <p> Start tracking on an app like MyFitnessPal or use a regular notebook. It'll help you stay accountable for what you've eaten. Plus, you can easily identify areas that could use a little improvement when it's written out in front of you.</p> <h2> 9. Take a walk!</h2> <p> Exercising at any time is good for you, but evening activity may be particularly beneficial because many people's metabolism slows down toward the end of the day. Thirty minutes of aerobic activity before dinner increases your metabolic rate and may keep it elevated for another two or three hours, even after you've stopped moving. Plus, it'll help you relax post-meal so you won't be tempted by stress-induced grazing that can rack up calories . </p> <span> boonchai wedmakawand</span> <span> Getty Images</span> <h2> 10. Resist the urge to skip a meal. </h2> <p> Skipping meals will not make you lose weight faster. If a hectic day makes a sit-down meal impossible, stash a piece of fruit and pack of nut butter in your car or purse and keep snacks in your desk drawer anything that will keep you from going hungry! </p> <p> Going long periods of time without food does double-duty harm on our healthy eating efforts by both slowing down your metabolism, and priming you for a binge later in the day. (Think: You've skipped breakfast and lunch, so you're ready to take down a whole turkey by dinner!) Make it your mission to eat three meals and two snacks every day, and don't wait longer than three to four hours without eating. Set a "snack alarm" on your phone if needed.</p> <h2> 11. Eat your H2O. </h2> <p> Sure, drinking plenty of water can help combat bloating, but you can (and should!) also consume high-water content foods . Reach for cucumbers, tomatoes, watermelon, asparagus, grapes, celery, artichokes, pineapple, and cranberries all of which contain diuretic properties that will also help you stay full due to their higher fiber content.</p> <span> Photo by Eduardo Barrera</span> <span> Getty Images</span> <h2> 12. Munch on mineral-rich foods. </h2> <p> Potassium , magnesium, and calcium can help to serve as a counter-balance for bloat-inducing sodium. Foods that are rich in potassium include leafy greens, most "orange" foods (oranges, sweet potatoes, carrots, melon), bananas, tomatoes, and cruciferous veggies especially cauliflower. Low-fat dairy, plus nuts, and seeds can also help give you a bloat-busting boost. They've also been linked to a whole host of additional health benefits, such as lowering blood pressure, controlling blood sugar, and reducing risk of chronic disease overall. </p> <h2> 13. Ignore the gimmicks. </h2> <p> At any given time, there are dozens of weight-loss hypes in the marketplace that claim to take off 10 pounds in 10 days or more . Desperation can tempt us to try anything from " clean eating " to cutting out food groups entirely. Keep in mind: Just because an avocado-kale-salad dripping in coconut oil is deemed "clean" by a so-called "expert" on your Instagram feed does not make it an unlimited food. Moral of the story? Avoid fads, eat real food, watch some Netflix, and unwind (perhaps with a glass of wine in hand). Now that's my kind of detox.</p> <h2> 14. Let yourself off the hook.</h2> <p> Many of us can't resist the urge to kick ourselves when we indulge, eat too much, or get thrown off course from restrictive diets. The problem: This only makes it more difficult, stressful, and downright impossible to lose weight. So rather than beating yourself up for eating foods you think you think you shouldn't , let it go. Treating yourself to about 200 calories worth of deliciousness each day something that feels indulgent to you can help you stay on track for the long haul, so allow yourself to eat, breathe, and indulge. Food should be joyful, not agonizing!</p> <h2> 15. Look for our emblem on food labels. </h2> <p> Ultimately, long-term weight loss requires some short-term behavior change and healthier habit formation. That's why we created our Good Housekeeping Nutritionist Approved Emblem, which exists to help turn smart food choices into healthier eating habits. All GHNA foods and drinks make it easier to find and eat good-for-you foods without additional time, effort, and cost. We target the lifestyle-related factors that make healthier eating hard, and find simple but creative solutions that actually work! Look for the emblem on labels wherever you shop for food.</p> <span> Jaclyn London, MS, RD, CDN</span> <span> A registered dietitian with a Bachelor of Arts degree from Northwestern University and a Master of Science degree in Clinical Nutrition from New York University, Jaclyn &ldquo;Jackie&rdquo; London handled all of Good Housekeeping&rsquo;s nutrition-related content, testing, and evaluation from 2014 to 2019.</span> This content is created and maintained by a third party, and imported onto this page to help users provide their email addresses.
