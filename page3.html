Get ready for weight loss without hunger.</p> <p> Our conventional ideas about weight loss – eat less, move more – require a lot of willpower. Counting calories, exercising for hours every day and trying to ignore your hunger? At DietDoctor, we believe that&#8217;s needless suffering, and likely a waste of your time and precious energy. </p> <p> Eventually people often give up. An excessive focus on counting calories has certainly not done much to reverse our current obesity epidemic. 1 Fortunately there may be a better way.</p> <p> The bottom line? Calories are not the only things that count in weight loss. Your weight is also hormonally regulated. If you reduce your hunger and the levels of your fat-storing hormone, insulin, you’ll likely have an easier time losing excess weight. 2 </p> DD+ MEMBERSHIP <h3> Start your FREE 30-day trial!</h3> <p> Get instant access to healthy low-carb and keto meal plans, fast and easy recipes, weight loss advice from medical experts, and so much more.

While a low-carb diet has many proven benefits, it&#8217;s still controversial. The main potential danger regards medications, especially for diabetes, where doses may need to be adapted . Discuss any changes in medication and relevant lifestyle changes with your doctor. Full disclaimer <i> </i> </p> <p> This guide is written for adults with health issues, including obesity, that could benefit from losing weight.</p> <p> We don&#8217;t recommend counting calories, which is controversial. To learn more about the rationale for this, see our guide on restricting calories for weight loss .</p> <p> Controversial topics related to a low-carb diet, and our take on them, include saturated fats , cholesterol , whole grains , red meat and whether the brain needs carbohydrates . <p> </p> <h2> 1. Choose a low-carb diet</h2> <p> </p> <p> If you want to lose weight, consider starting by avoiding sugar and starch (like bread, pasta and potatoes). This is an old idea: for 150 years or more there have been a huge number of weight-loss diets based on eating fewer carbs. What&#8217;s new is that reviews of modern scientific studies have repeatedly shown that low carb is at least as good, if not better, than other approaches to diet. 4 <p> Obviously, it&#8217;s still possible to lose weight on any diet – just eat fewer calories than you burn, right? The problem with this simplistic advice is that it ignores the elephant in the room: hunger. Most people don&#8217;t like to &#8220;just eat less,&#8221; as it may result in having to go hungry forever. Sooner or later, many will likely give up and eat without restriction, hence the prevalence of &#8220;yo-yo dieting.&#8221; 5 While it should be possible to lose weight on any diet, some appear to make it easier and some to make it much harder.</p> <p> The main advantage of the low-carb diet is that it may cause you to want to eat less . 6 Even without counting calories, overweight people tend to eat fewer calories on low carb. 7 Thus, <strong> calories count, but you don&#8217;t need to count them.</strong> </p> <p> A 2012 study also showed that people who had lost weight  experienced far less reduction in total energy expenditure (the number of calories burned within a 24-hour period) when they followed a low-carb diet compared to a low-fat diet during weight maintenance — a 300-calorie difference, in fact. 8 <p> According to one of the Harvard professors behind the study, this advantage  &#8220;would equal the number of calories typically burned in an hour of moderate-intensity physical activity.” Imagine that: an entire bonus hour of exercise every day, without actually exercising.</p> <p> Recently, an even larger and more carefully conducted study confirmed this metabolism-sparing effect, with different groups of people who had lost weight burning an average of between 200 and almost 500 extra calories per day on a low-carb maintenance diet compared to a high-carb or moderate-carb diet. 9 <p> <strong> Bottom line:</strong> A low-carb diet can reduce your hunger, making it easier to eat less. And it might even increase your fat burning at rest. Study after study shows that low carb works for weight loss and that on average it  improves important health markers . 10 <p> Why low carb can help you lose weight <i> </i> </p> <p> How to lose weight with a low-carb diet <i> </i> </p> <h3> Learn more about keto and low-carb</h3> <p> Do you want to know more about exactly what to eat on low carb, how to do it, potential problems and solutions — and find lots of great recipes?

Eat when hungry</h2> <p> </p> <p> Eating when hungry sounds simple: <strong> if you&#8217;re not hungry, you probably don&#8217;t need to eat yet</strong> . </p> <p> When on a low-carb or keto diet you can trust your feelings of hunger and satiety again — something many people following a low-fat or standard American diet cannot do. 11 Feel free to eat as many — or as few — times per day as you feel is right for you.</p> <p> Some people eat three times a day and occasionally  snack  in between (note that frequent snacking could mean that you&#8217;d benefit from adding protein, fibrous veggies, or extra fat calories to your meals, to increase satiety). However, there&#8217;s some evidence that frequent snacking may not be wise when trying to lose weight. 12  Some people only eat once or twice a day and never snack. Whatever works for you. Just eat when you&#8217;re hungry, and don&#8217;t eat when you aren&#8217;t.</p> <p> It also helps that low-carb diets and higher protein diets tend to reduce hunger.</p> <p> Studies demonstrate that people eating a very low-carb, ketogenic diet reduce their feelings of hunger and the amount of food they eat. 13 <p> Multiple other studies demonstrate that adding protein to your diet markedly reduces hunger and food intake. 14 <p> Our suggestion? Try a low-carb, higher protein approach and see what happens to your hunger levels. 15 <p> Read more about why eating when hungry is smarter than counting calories <i> </i> </p> <p> </p> <h2> 3. Eat real, minimally processed food</h2> <p> <br/> Another common mistake when eating a low-carb diet is getting fooled by the creative marketing of special &#8220;low-carb&#8221; products.</p> <p> Remember:  an effective low-carb diet for weight loss should be based primarily on  whole food .</p> <p> Prioritize what humans have been eating for thousands or likely millions of years, e.g. meat, fish, vegetables, eggs, butter, olives, nuts etc. 16 <p> <strong> If you want to lose weight, avoid special &#8220;low-carb&#8221; products that are full of carbs.</strong>  This should be obvious, but creative marketers are doing all they can to fool you (and get your money). They will tell you that you can eat cookies, pasta, ice cream, bread and plenty of chocolate on a low-carb diet, as long as you buy their brand. They&#8217;re often full of carbohydrates. Don&#8217;t be fooled.</p> <p> How about low-carb bread? Be careful: if it&#8217;s baked with grains it&#8217;s certainly  not low carb. But some companies still try to sell it to you as a low-carb option.</p> <p> Low-carb chocolate is usually full of a kind of sugar alcohol — maltitol — that may actually be partially absorbed by the body, but which the manufacturer does not count as carbs. If the maltitol is absorbed, it is likely to raise blood sugar and insulin levels. 17 The remaining carbs end up in the colon, potentially causing gas and diarrhea.</p> <p> While low-carb chocolate made with erythritol or stevia is likely to be okay, you still have to consider that any sweeteners can maintain sugar cravings. 18 </p> <p> Two simple rules to avoid being tricked into purchasing unhealthy &#8220;low carb&#8221; products:</p> Don&#8217;t buy &#8220;low carb&#8221; versions of high carb stuff, like cookies, bars, chocolate, bread, pasta or ice cream – unless you are sure of the ingredients (ideally, by making it yourself). Avoid products with the words &#8220;net carbs&#8221; on them. That may be a way to deceive you. <p> Focus on eating good quality, minimally processed real food. Ideally the food you buy shouldn&#8217;t even have a list of ingredients (or it should be very short).</p> <p> Read more about fake low-carb products <i> </i> </p> <p> Read more about sweeteners <i> </i> </p> <h3> Less moderation, more quality</h3> <p> Finally — you may want to forget about the old “everything in moderation” diet motto. It isn&#8217;t necessarily helpful advice for people who struggle with weight — in fact, it may be exactly the opposite. 19 <p> Don’t eat everything in moderation. Eat as much healthy food as you can, whenever you are hungry. Eat as little unhealthy food as you can if possible, none at all. <br/> <h2> 4. Eat only when hungry</h2> <p> <br/> On a low-carb diet you should aim to eat when hungry (see tip #2 above). And if you&#8217;re not hungry? Don&#8217;t eat. Frequently eating more food than you need to stay satisfied will slow down weight loss. 20 This, in fact, is so important that it&#8217;s worth a section of its own.</p> <h4> Limit unnecessary snacking</h4> <p> Unnecessary snacking can be a problem on a low-carb diet too. Some things are easy to eat just because they’re tasty and readily available. Here are three common traps to watch out for on a low-carb or keto diet: 21 <strong> Dairy products</strong> such as cream and cheeses. They work well in cooking, as they satisfy. But problems arise when you’re munching a lot of cheese in front of the TV in the evening — without being hungry. Be careful with that. Another problem might be having lots of cream with dessert, when you’re actually already full and just keep eating because it tastes good. Another common culprit is loads of heavy cream in the coffee, many times per day. <strong> Nuts</strong> . It&#8217;s very easy to eat until the nuts are gone, regardless of how full you are. A tip: According to science , salted nuts are harder to stop eating than unsalted nuts. 22 Salted nuts tempt you to more overeating. Good to know. Another tip: Avoid bringing the entire bag to the couch choose a small bowl instead. Personally, I often eat all the nuts in front of me, whether I’m hungry or not. <strong> Low-carb baking</strong> . Even if you’re only using almond flour and sweeteners, snacking on baked goods and cookies usually represents additional eating when you’re not hungry — and yes, this will slow down weight loss. <h4> Feel free to skip meals</h4> <p> Do you have to eat breakfast? Research has confirmed that the answer is no. 23 Don&#8217;t eat if you&#8217;re not hungry. And this goes for any meal.</p> <p> On a strict low-carb diet the hunger and urge to eat tend to decrease significantly. 24 If this happens, be happy! Don&#8217;t fight it by eating food you don&#8217;t want. Instead, wait for the hunger to return before you eat again. This will save you both time and money, while speeding up your weight loss.</p> <p> Some people fear that they will lose control if they don&#8217;t eat every three hours. The concern that this &#8220;urge to binge&#8221; will blow their diets completely leads them to obsessively snack all the time.</p> <p> This constant snacking may be necessary in order to control the hunger and craving that may arise during a diet high in sugar and starchy carbs, but it&#8217;s usually unnecessary on a low-carb diet. Hunger will only slowly return and you should have plenty of time to prepare food or grab a snack.</p> <p> <strong> Bottom line:</strong> To lose weight in a sustainable way, eat when you’re hungry – but only when you’re hungry. Forget the clock and listen to your body instead.<br/> </p> <h4> Learn more</h4> <span> </span> <span> Breakfast!

Measure your progress wisely</h2> <p> </p> <p> Tracking successful weight loss is sometimes trickier than you&#8217;d think. Focusing primarily on weight and stepping on the scale every day might be misleading, cause unnecessary anxiety, and undermine your motivation for no good reason.</p> <p> The scale is not necessarily your friend. You may want to lose fat – but the scale measures muscles, bone and internal organs as well. Gaining muscle is a good thing. Thus weight or  BMI  are imperfect ways to measure your progress. This is especially true if you&#8217;re just coming off a long period of semi-starvation (which may accompany calorie-counting), as your body may want to restore lost muscle. Starting weight training and gaining muscle can also hide your fat loss.</p> <p> Losing fat and gaining muscle means great progress, but you may miss this if you only measure your weight. Thus it&#8217;s best to quantify body composition as you lose weight. You can do this with a DEXA scan, hydrostatic weights, plethysmography scales and others. But if these are not available, it is smart to also track the disappearance of your belly fat, by measuring your <strong> waist circumference</strong> .</p> <h4> Here&#8217;s how to do it:</h4> Put the measuring tape around your middle, slightly above your belly button  (to be exact: at the midpoint between your lowest rib and the top of your hipbone, at your side) Exhale and relax (don&#8217;t suck in your stomach) Make sure the measuring tape fits snugly, without compressing your skin Measure Compare your result to these recommendations:</p> <p> </p> <p> I recommend aiming for &#8220;good&#8221; but it&#8217;s not always realistic. Young people can usually achieve this, but for some middle-aged or older people, it may be a major victory to get all the way to &#8220;decent&#8221;. 25 <h4> Measuring progress</h4> <p> I suggest measuring your waist circumference and weight before starting your weight-loss journey and then perhaps once a week or once a month. Write the results down so that you can track your progress. If you want, you can measure more areas: around the buttocks, the chest, the arms, legs, etc.</p> <p> Please note that your weight can fluctuate up and down several pounds from day to day, depending on fluid balance and digestive system contents. Don&#8217;t worry about short-term changes, follow the long-term trend instead.</p> <h4> If you can, check other important health markers when starting out, like these:</h4> Blood pressure Blood sugar (fasting blood glucose and/or HbA1c) Cholesterol profile (including HDL, triglycerides) <p> These markers are frequently improved on a low-carb diet, even before major weight loss. 26 Re-checking these health markers after a few months can be great for your motivation as  they&#8217;ll usually show  that you&#8217;re not just losing weight, you&#8217;re gaining health too.</p> <p> <strong> PS:</strong>  Don&#8217;t have a measuring tape at home? Try these options: </p> Use any piece of string. Wrap the string around your waist and cut the string to fit your waist on day one. This string could magically appear to become longer and longer every week you wrap it around your waist.  Comparing how an old pair of jeans fits is also a good option. </p> <h2> 6. Be persistent</h2> <p> </p> <p> It usually takes years or decades to gain a lot of weight. Trying to lose it all as quickly as possible by starving yourself does not necessarily work well in the long term; instead it may be a recipe for “yo-yo dieting”. 27 <p> In addition, you need to set realistic expectations for health and weight loss goals. You can read more in our detailed guide on realistic expectations . </p> <h4> What to aim for</h4> <p> It&#8217;s common to lose <strong> 2-6 pounds (1-3 kg) within the first week</strong>  on a strict low-carb diet, and then on average about <strong> one pound (0.5 kg) per week </strong> as long as you have a lot of weight remaining to lose. 28 This translates into about 50 pounds (23 kilos) per year. However, weight loss doesn&#8217;t occur at this rate in everyone.</p> <p> Every 5 pounds of fat loss roughly equals 1 inch lost around the waist (1 kilo = 1 cm).</p> <p> Young males sometimes lose weight faster than this, perhaps twice as fast. 29 Post-menopausal women may lose at a slower pace. 30 People on a very strict low-carb diet may lose weight quicker, as well as those who exercise a lot (a bonus). 31 And if you have an enormous amount of excess weight to lose, you could start out much faster — although initially, some of the weight you lose will be due to water loss.</p> <p> As you get closer to your ideal weight, the loss may slow down until you stabilize at a weight that your body feels is right. Very few people become underweight on a low-carb diet as long as they eat when hungry.</p> Read other peoples&#8217; stories <h4> Initial stalls</h4> <p> Are you coming off a period of semi-starvation (which can occur with calorie-counting)? Focus on your waist circumference and health markers (see tip #4) at first, as it sometimes takes several weeks before weight loss is apparent. 32 <h4> Weight-loss plateaus</h4> <p> Expect weight-loss plateaus: months where nothing seems to happen on the scale. Everybody hits them. 33 Stay calm. Keep doing what you&#8217;re doing and eventually things should start happening again (if not, check out the other 17 tips).</p> <p> More: Top 10 tips top break a weight loss stall </p> <h4> How to keep the weight off long term</h4> <p> Losing a lot of weight long term and keeping it off will likely not happen unless you <strong> change your habits forever</strong> . If you lose weight and then return to living exactly the way you did when you gained weight, don&#8217;t be surprised when the excess weight returns. It normally will.</p> <p> Maintaining weight loss usually requires long-term change and patience. As tempting as it may be, don&#8217;t fall for  one of these magical diet scams .</p> <p> Forget quick fixes: If you lose some weight every month, eventually you may get rid of all your excess weight. That&#8217;s inevitable progress. That&#8217;s what you want.</p> <p> PS: Long-term change is hardest in the beginning, especially during the first couple of weeks. It&#8217;s like quitting smoking. Once you develop new habits it becomes easier and easier every week. Eventually it may come naturally. </p> <p> For inspiration and tips, check out some of our long-term weight maintenance success stories :</p> Karen: Maintaining a 70-pound weight loss for five years How Melissa lost 100 pounds with a keto diet, and kept it off for 15 years Brian: Maintaining a 100-pound weight loss for seven years <h4> How to lose weight faster </h4> <p> Keep reading!<br/> <p> <br/> <h2> 7. Avoid overeating fruit</h2> <p> This piece of advice is controversial, as fruit has an almost magical health aura today. While fruit does contain fiber, antioxidants, and important vitamins, it also contains a fair amount of sugar – around 10% by weight (the rest is mostly water). 34 Just taste an orange or a grape. Sweet, right?</p> <p> Eating whole fruits in moderation especially ones that are low in sugar, like berries can absolutely be part of a healthy diet. The soluble fiber in fruit can help with short-term satiety; it also reacts with water in your gut to form a thick gel that helps delay and reduce the amount of sugar absorbed from that fruit. In fact, up to 30% of the sugar from fruit may not be absorbed. 35 <p> Larger quantities of fruit, however, will deliver a significant sugar load to your intestines. Even if only 70% of that sugar is absorbed, 70% of a big number is still a big number. For example, five servings of fruit per day can be equivalent to the amount of sugar in 16 ounces (500 ml) of soda 52 grams of sugar! 36 <strong> Low-carb fruits and berries – the best and the worst <i> </i> </strong> <h3> Isn&#8217;t fruit natural?</h3> <p> Most people believe that fruit is natural, but today&#8217;s fruits in the grocery store have very little in common with what fruits looked like before they were cultured. Modern domesticated fruits are larger, less bitter, and have thinner peels and smaller seeds. This makes them tastier and easier to eat and because of their increased size, they may provide more sugar per piece of fruit than their earlier counterparts. </p> <p> <p> <strong> What fruits and vegetables looked like before</strong> </p> <p> </p> <strong> Bottom line: Fruit is candy from nature. Enjoy responsibly.</strong> </p> <h2> 8. Avoid drinking beer</h2> <p> <strong> Beer contains rapidly digested carbs that shut down fat burning</strong> . That may be why beer is sometimes referred to as &#8220;liquid bread.&#8221; There&#8217;s a good reason for the term “beer belly.” 37 <p> Here are smarter (lower-carb) alcoholic options when trying to lose weight:</p> Wine (red or dry white) Dry champagne Hard liquor like whisky, cognac, vodka (avoid sweetened cocktails – try vodka, soda water, lime instead) <p> These drinks hardly contain any sugar or digestible carbohydrates so they&#8217;re better than beer. However, large amounts of alcohol might slow weight loss, so moderation is still a good idea. 38 <p> <br/> <strong> Low&#8209;carb alcohol –<br/> the best and the worst <i> </i> </strong> <br/> <p> <br/> <h2> 9. Avoid non-caloric sweeteners</h2> <p> <br/> Many people replace sugar with non-caloric sweeteners in the belief that this will reduce their calorie intake and cause weight loss. It sounds plausible. Several studies, however, have failed to show obvious positive effect on weight loss by consuming non-caloric sweeteners instead of plain sugar. 39 <p> According to scientific studies, non-caloric sweeteners may  increase appetite and maintain cravings for sweet food . 40 And one recent independent study showed that switching drinks with non-caloric sweeteners to water helped women lose weight. 41 <p> <strong> Study: Avoiding diet beverages helps women lose weight</strong> </p> <p> This may be related to the increased insulin secretion seen with some non-caloric sweeteners. 42 Maybe that is why something odd happened when I tested Pepsi Max. </p> <p> If you&#8217;re having trouble losing weight, I suggest that you avoid sweeteners. As a bonus, you&#8217;ll likely find it easier to enjoy the natural sweetness of real food, once you&#8217;re no longer adapted to the overpowering sweetness of processed low-carb food products and &#8220;diet&#8221; sodas.</p> <strong> Full low-carb sweeteners guide <i> </i> </strong> <h3> Sugar addiction</h3> <p> Do you find the idea of avoiding sweeteners almost impossible to imagine?

Discuss any change in treatment with your doctor. Here are the three most common offenders:<span> </span> </p> <strong> Insulin injections</strong> , especially at higher doses, are probably the worst obstacle for weight loss for many people. 43 There are three ways to reduce your need for insulin:</p> <p> <strong> A. </strong>   Eat fewer carbs , which makes it easier to lose weight. The fewer carbs you eat the less insulin you need. 44 Remember to work closely with your healthcare provider to ensure you safely lower your doses.</p> <p> <strong> B. </strong>  If this isn’t enough, treatment with metformin (an insulin sensitizing drug) can decrease the need for insulin (at least for people with type 2 diabetes). 45 <p> <strong> C. </strong>  If this is not enough to get off insulin (again, for people with type 2 diabetes), discuss with your doctor if it is appropriate to try a drug in one of the newer classes like the GLP-1 analogues or DPP-4 inhibitors. There are many different options within these two categories; what you need to know is the drugs in these classes reduce the need for insulin and may also cause weight loss by other mechanisms — beyond just the effect of using less insulin.</p> <p> You can learn more in our guide on starting low-carb or keto with diabetes medications . <strong> Other diabetes medications,</strong> like drugs that stimulate the secretion of insulin by the pancreas (e.g. sulfonylureas), often lead to weight gain. 46 These include: Amaryl (glimepiride), Glucotrol/Minodiab (glipizide), Euglucon (glibenclamide), and Daonil (glyburide). Additional diabetes medications like Actos (pioglitazone), Starlix (nateglinide) and Prandin/NovoNorm (repaglinide) also encourage weight gain. But not metformin. More on diabetes <strong> Cortisone</strong> and other glucocorticoids (e.g. prednisone, prednisolone, dexamethasone) are also common offenders. These drugs may cause weight gain in the long run, especially at higher doses (e.g. more than 5 mg prednisolone per day). 47 Unfortunately, a medication like cortisone is often essential for those who are prescribed it, but the dose should be adjusted frequently in concert with your healthcare provider so you don’t take more than you need. <p> These other medications can also cause problems:</p> <strong> Neuroleptics/antipsychotic drugs</strong> can often encourage weight gain, especially newer drugs like Zyprexa (olanzapine). <strong> Some antidepressant medications</strong> can cause weight gain, especially the older tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) such as Elavil/Tryptizol/Saroten (amitriptyline), and Anafranil (clomipramine); as well as newer drugs such as Remeron (mirtazapine). 48 Lithium (for bipolar disorder) often causes weight gain. The most commonly prescribed antidepressants, in a class known as SSRI’s, generally have less of an impact on weight. 49 More on depression <strong> Some contraceptives </strong> may contribute to a slight weight gain, primarily those that contain only progesterone and no estrogen, for example the mini-pill, the contraceptive injection, or a contraceptive implant. 50 More on fertility <strong> Blood pressure medication</strong> in the form of beta blockers may lead to weight gain in some individuals. This class includes: Seloken/Lopressor (metoprolol), Tenormin (atenolol), and many others. More on high blood pressure <strong> Epilepsy drugs</strong>  may cause weight gain (e.g. carbamazepine and valproate). <strong> Allergy medications</strong> and antihistamines can interfere with weight loss, especially at high doses. Cortisone is even worse (see above).  More on allergies <strong> Antibiotics</strong>  may possibly lead to a temporary weight gain by disturbing the gut microbiota and increasing the amount of energy we absorb from food. 51 This is still speculative for humans but it&#8217;s a reason to not use antibiotics unless you truly need them. <p> <br/> <h2> 11. Stress less, sleep more</h2> <p> </p> <p> Have you ever wished for more hours of sleep and a less stressful life in general? Most people have stress and lack of sleep can be bad news for weight. </p> <p> Chronic stress and inadequate sleep may increase levels of stress hormones such as cortisol in your body. This can cause increased hunger, resulting in overeating highly palatable foods and therefore weight gain. 52 If you&#8217;re looking to lose weight, you should <strong> review possible ways to decrease or better handle excessive stress in your life</strong> . Although this often demands substantial changes, it may immediately affect your stress hormone levels and perhaps your weight.</p> <p> You should also make an effort to <strong> get enough good sleep, preferably every night</strong> . Strive to wake up refreshed of your own accord, independently of the alarm clock. If you&#8217;re the kind of person who always gets brutally woken up by the alarm ringing, you might never be giving your body completely adequate rest.</p> <p> One way to combat this is to go to bed early enough for your body to wake up autonomously before the alarm clock goes off. Letting yourself get a good night&#8217;s sleep is another way of reducing stress hormone levels.</p> <p> Sleep deprivation, on the other hand, goes hand in hand with sugar cravings. 53 It also has an adverse effect on self-discipline and makes it painfully easy to give in to temptation (it&#8217;s no coincidence that induced sleep deprivation is a common interrogation technique). Similarly, sleep deprivation weakens your resolve to work out.</p> <h4> Sleep issues?</h4> <p> Do you have trouble sleeping even if there&#8217;s ample time for it? Here are five tips from an expert :</p> <b> Stick to the same bedtime every evening.</b> In the long run, this will help your body prepare for sleep at that time. <b> No coffee after 2 pm.</b> Just don&#8217;t and remember that it takes time for caffeine to leave your body. <b> Limit your alcohol intake to three hours before bedtime.</b> While booze might make you woozy, it worsens quality of sleep. <b> Limit exercise in the four hours before bedtime.</b> Physical activity can wind you up and make it difficult to go to sleep for several hours afterwards. <b> Get 15 minutes of sunlight every day.</b> This is good for your circadian rhythm (your &#8220;body clock&#8221;). <p> Finally, make sure that your bedroom is dark enough, and stays at a pleasant temperature. Sleep well!</p> <h4> Difficult, but worthwhile</h4> <p> Many may find the above guidelines difficult to follow, perhaps because of a lack of time (or the equivalent small children!). But stressing less and sleeping more doesn&#8217;t just feel good. It can also play a part in helping you get leaner.</p> <p> Read more about the benefits of sleep <i> </i> <br/> <p> <br/> <h2> 12. Eat less dairy products and nuts</h2> <p> </p> <p> Can you eat as much as you like and still lose weight? This often works well with a low-carbohydrate diet, as appetite regulation often improves. 54 <p> However, despite the fact that a low-carbohydrate diet generally makes it easier to eat just enough, there are foods classified as low carb which become a problem in larger quantities. If you find yourself having a hard time losing weight on a low-carb diet, you could try to be more careful with:</p> <b> Dairy products </b> (yogurt, cream, cheese) <b> Nuts</b> <p> Dairy products contain varying amounts of lactose (milk sugar), which could slow down weight loss when over-consumed. Consequently, cutting back on dairy products may help accelerate weight loss.</p> <p> This applies especially to dairy products typically lacking in fat, such as regular milk and various yogurts.</p> <p> However, if you&#8217;re struggling to lose weight, you should avoid large amounts of full-fat dairy, such as cream and cheese. Remember that, gram for gram, fat has twice the calories of carbs or protein; therefore, high-fat, highly palatable foods can deliver a huge calorie load before you know it. 55 <p> When it comes to cashew nuts are among the worst carb-wise you&#8217;ll find that they contain around 20% carbohydrate by weight.</p> <p> This means that consuming 100 grams of cashews (which happens in a flash!) will fill your daily quota. macadamia nuts (usually around 5% carbs), or
